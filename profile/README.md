# CodigoSH

The core organization for scalable interface systems and software architecture. We build tools that prioritize performance, maintainability, and clean implementation.

---

### Systems & Engineering

We maintain a collection of high-level building blocks for modern web development, focusing on the intersection of declarative logic and modular styling.

* **Design Systems**: Low-level CSS architectures (CSS-in-JS, PostCSS, Utility-first) focused on design tokens and performance.
* **Logic Modules**: Decoupled JavaScript engines built for reusability across different frameworks.
* **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines optimized for frontend asset delivery and quality assurance.

### Project Standards

Every repository under **CodigoSH** adheres to a strict set of engineering standards to ensure long-term stability:

1.  **Strict Typing**: Type-safe implementations wherever possible.
2.  **Modular CSS**: Component-based styling using BEM or scoped modules to avoid side effects.
3.  **Predictable Logic**: Functional programming patterns and immutable state management.
4.  **Documentation**: Mandatory technical specifications for every public module.

### Contributing
