# 👋 Welcome to CodigoSH

We're a small but ambitious team building modern and efficient tools. We focus on clean development, scalable architectures, and user experiences that actually work.

## What we do

At CodigoSH we believe software should be:
- **Fast** - Optimized from the start, no unnecessary bloat
- **Modular** - Independent components that make maintenance easier
- **Accessible** - Designed to be used, not just admired

## Featured Project: Lastboard

**[Lastboard](https://github.com/CodigoSH/Lastboard)** is our flagship: a high-performance personal dashboard that replaces heavy alternatives with a lightweight, modern experience.

- Single binary - Deploy in seconds
- Premium UI with glassmorphism
- Native grid system without heavy dependencies
- Full dark/light theme support

## Our values

### Clean code first
Every project follows strict linting standards and modular structure. We believe code should be easy to read and maintain.

### Performance above all
We make technical decisions that prioritize speed and efficiency. If something can be done faster without compromising quality, we do it.

### Continuous learning
We're a growing team, always exploring new technologies and better ways to solve problems.
